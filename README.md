# PLM-APGAS
## Library for fault-tolerant, distributed, parallel programming in Java

This repository is a fork  of the official APGAS repository (https://github.com/x10-lang/apgas) and adds some new features.

Examples, benchmarks and fault tolerant global load balancing frameworks are contained in: https://github.com/posnerj/PLM-APGAS-Applications
